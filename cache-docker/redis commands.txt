Notes:
Don't cache (Select * from ) queries. Redis caches these records under a SimpleKey[] cache. These caches don't get updated when we use a Key for any @CachePut(..) operations 

Commands:
docker exec -it {container_id} redis-cli

GET key
DEL key1 key2 key3 

To delete all keys in the database:
FLUSHDB
